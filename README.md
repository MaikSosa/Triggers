# Overview

PL/SQL can offers a great deal of offers and tools that can manage big production databases. One of most useful features Oracle PL/SQL offer are triggers. Triggers are specialized programs that can keep record and alert for any activity in the detabase. "They run between the time you issue a command and the time you perform the database management system action" (*Oracle Database 12c PL/SQL Programming p.492*).

In this code I practice not only the creation of triggers but also, data manipulation of the database, insertion of new data, deletion of data, and custom error handling. I was able to learn how to write triggersw for INSERT and UPDATE statements.
